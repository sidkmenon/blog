1. Do not ask me when running non-mutating commands; e.g. `npm run check` etc. I repeat, **this is important**, do not ask me ever to run commands like `rg`, `sed`, `find`, or variants like that. if it does not mutate anything, I don't want to be asked to approve it. Just tell me what you're doing.
